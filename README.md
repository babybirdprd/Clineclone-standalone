# Cline Project Roadmap

## Overall Goal

To develop an autonomous coding assistant that empowers developers to efficiently tackle complex software development tasks through a safe and intuitive human-in-the-loop interface.

## Key Features

- [x] Multi-provider LLM support (Anthropic, OpenRouter, AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, OpenAI, etc.)
- [x] Local model support (Ollama)
- [x] Streaming responses with real-time editor integration
- [x] Human-in-the-loop file editing and command execution
- [x] Contextual awareness (file details, open editors, terminal output)
- [x] Support for images and website inspection
- [x] Task history and resumption
- [x] Contextual mentions (@file, @folder, @problems, @url)
- [x] Cost tracking and estimation

## Completion Criteria

- Stable and performant application across different operating systems and LLM providers.
- Comprehensive documentation and user guides.
- Positive user feedback and adoption.

## Future Scalability Considerations

- Plugin system for extending functionality.
- Integration with other development tools and services.
- Enhanced code understanding and generation capabilities.
- Personalized assistant behavior based on user preferences and coding style.
- Collaborative coding features for team projects.

## Current Goals

### Goal 1: Enhance Mobile Responsiveness

- [ ] Implement responsive layout for the chat interface.
- [ ] Optimize editor and terminal components for touch input.
- [ ] Explore alternative workflows for mobile devices (e.g., code review, simplified terminal).

### Goal 2: Improve Code Understanding

- [ ] Integrate more advanced code analysis tools.
- [ ] Enhance context management for larger projects.
- [ ] Explore techniques for code summarization and explanation.

### Goal 3: Expand Toolset

- [ ] Create a plugin system for community contributions.

## Completed Tasks

- Implemented multi-provider LLM support.

- Developed a diff view for file changes.
- Integrated linters and compilers for error detection.
- Implemented problem matching for editor integration.
- Added support for images and website inspection.
- Implemented task history and resumption.
- Added contextual mentions.
- Implemented cost tracking and estimation.
- Released version 1.0.
- Implemented streaming LLM responses.
- Added support for contextual mentions.
- Improved error detection and handling.
- Enhanced UI/UX for better user experience.
- Released version 2.0.

### cline_docs/currentTask.md

```markdown
# Current Task

## Objective

Refine the user interface for improved responsiveness and mobile compatibility.  This aligns with Goal 1 in the project roadmap.

## Context

- Current UI is primarily designed for desktop use and doesn't adapt well to smaller screens.
- Users have requested better mobile support for accessing and reviewing code on the go.
- Terminal interaction on mobile presents significant challenges.

## Next Steps

- Investigate responsive UI libraries and frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS).
- Experiment with different editor and terminal components for mobile compatibility.
- Explore alternative workflows for mobile users that prioritize code review and feedback over direct editing and terminal access.
- Conduct user testing on different mobile devices and screen sizes.
- Gather feedback and iterate on the UI design.

### cline_docs/techStack.md

```markdown
# Cline Tech Stack

## Frontend

- **React:**  Chosen for its component-based architecture, large community, and performance.
- **VS Code Webview UI Toolkit:**  Provides VS Code-styled UI components for a consistent look and feel within the editor.  Will need to be replaced with a standard UI library for a standalone app.
- **TypeScript:**  Used for type safety and improved code maintainability.
- **Styled Components:**  Used for styling the UI components.

## Backend

- **TypeScript:**  Used for type safety and improved code maintainability.
- **Node.js:**  Provides the runtime environment for the extension backend.

## Language Processing

- **Tree-sitter:**  Used for parsing source code and extracting definitions.  Offers efficient and robust parsing capabilities.
- **Ripgrep:**  Used for fast regex searching within files.

## Other

- **VS Code API:**  Used for interacting with the VS Code editor, terminal, and file system.  Will need to be replaced with custom implementations for a standalone app.
- **Puppeteer:** Used for web scraping and screenshot capture.
- **Various npm packages:**  Used for utility functions, data structures, and other functionalities.  See `package.json` for a full list.

# Cline Codebase Summary

## Key Components and Their Interactions

### Cline Class (`src/core/Cline.ts`)

- Manages the task lifecycle (initiation, context loading, LLM interaction, tool execution, completion).
- Handles communication with the LLM API via the `ApiHandler` interface.
- Executes tools based on LLM instructions.
- Interacts with VS Code API for editor integration, terminal management, and file system access.

### API Handlers (`src/api/providers`)

- Abstract away the interaction with different LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenRouter, etc.).
- Implement the `ApiHandler` interface for a consistent API.

### Services (`src/services`)

- Provide core functionalities like file system access (`fs`), web browsing (`UrlContentFetcher`), file searching (`ripgrep`), and source code parsing (`tree-sitter`).

### Integrations (`src/integrations`)

- Handle interactions with VS Code, such as editor integration (`DecorationController`, `DiffViewProvider`), terminal management (`TerminalManager`), and theme integration.

### Shared Components (`src/shared`)

- TypeScript components shared between the webview UI and the extension backend.
- Includes API definitions, data structures like `HistoryItem`, and utility functions.

## Data Flow

1. User inputs task description and images in the webview UI.
2. Webview UI sends message to extension backend.
3. Extension backend creates a `Cline` instance.
4. `Cline` loads context and sends request to LLM API.
5. LLM streams response back to extension backend.
6. Extension backend parses response and executes tools (with user approval).
7. Results are displayed in the webview UI.
8. Task history is saved to disk.

## External Dependencies

- **LLM APIs:**  Managed through the `ApiHandler` interface and provider-specific handlers.
- **Node.js modules:**  Managed through `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
- **VS Code API:**  Used for editor and terminal integration.

## Recent Significant Changes

- Implemented streaming LLM responses for improved user experience.
- Added support for contextual mentions for richer context integration.
- Improved error detection and handling for more robust operation.

## User Feedback Integration

- User feedback is collected through GitHub issues, the VS Code Marketplace, and a dedicated Discord server.
- Feedback is used to prioritize features, identify bugs, and improve the overall user experience.

## Additional Documentation

- See `cline_docs/styleAesthetic.md` for UI style guidelines.
- See `cline_docs/wireframes.md` for UI wireframes and mockups.
```

### Additional Files

Create `cline_docs/styleAesthetic.md` and `cline_docs/wireframes.md` with relevant content as needed.  These files would contain information about the visual style and layout of the UI, respectively.  This structure provides a clear and organized way to document the Cline project, making it easier for developers to understand, maintain, and contribute to the codebase.  The verbose descriptions and specific instructions ensure that the documentation is comprehensive and easy to follow.  The inclusion of future scalability considerations and user feedback integration highlights the project's long-term vision and commitment to user satisfaction.
