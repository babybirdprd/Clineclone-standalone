# Cline Standalone App Project Roadmap

## Overall Goal

Convert the Cline VS Code extension into a standalone cross-platform desktop application using Tauri, incorporating a built-in code editor (CodeMirror), file system access, and an independent error detection system.

## Key Features

- **Standalone Code Editor:** Integrate CodeMirror as the built-in editor, replicating essential features from VS Code (syntax highlighting, code completion, etc.).
- **File System Access:** Implement file system operations (open, save, create, delete, rename) independently of VS Code.
- **Independent Error Detection:** Integrate linters and compilers directly, parsing their output to display errors and warnings.
- **Embedded Terminal:**  Embed a terminal emulator (e.g., xterm.js) and handle shell integration independently.
- **Standalone UI:**  Replace VS Code Webview UI Toolkit with a standard UI framework (e.g., React) and adapt existing components.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Package and distribute the app for Windows, macOS, and Linux using Tauri.

## Completion Criteria

- All core Cline functionalities (task management, tool execution, context loading) should work seamlessly in the standalone app.
- The standalone app should have comparable performance to the VS Code extension.
- The app should be packaged and readily distributable for all target platforms.

## cline_docs/currentTask.md

# Cline Standalone App - Current Task

## Current Objective

Integrate CodeMirror as the code editor component and implement basic file system operations (open, save, create, delete) in the standalone Tauri application.  This addresses the first phase of the project roadmap (Editor and File System Integration).

## Context

- The existing Cline extension relies heavily on the VS Code API for editor and file system access.  These functionalities need to be replaced with standalone implementations.
- CodeMirror has been chosen as the editor due to its flexibility and features.
- Node.js's `fs` module will be used for file system operations initially, with potential for a cross-platform library later.

## Next Steps

- **Install CodeMirror and integrate it into the React UI.**  This involves setting up the editor instance, configuring keybindings and themes, and handling text input and changes.
- **Implement file opening and saving.** Use the `fs` module to read and write file contents.  Handle different file encodings and potential errors.
- **Implement file creation and deletion.**  Use the `fs` module to create new files and delete existing ones.  Handle potential errors and user confirmations.
- **Implement file change diffing.**  Use a diffing library (e.g., `diff`) to compare file versions and display the changes in a user-friendly format.  This will involve creating a dedicated diff view component.
- **Adapt the existing UI to work with CodeMirror and the new file system interactions.**  This includes updating event handlers and data flow.

## Relation to Project Roadmap

This task directly addresses the following items from the project roadmap:

- [x] Choose a suitable code editor component (CodeMirror).
- [x] Integrate CodeMirror into the application.
- [ ] Implement basic file system operations (open, save, create, delete).
- [ ] Implement file change diffing and display.
- [ ] Adapt existing UI components to the new UI framework.

## cline_docs/techStack.md

```markdown
# Cline Standalone App - Tech Stack

## Frontend

- **UI Framework:** React -  Chosen for its component-based architecture, flexibility, and large community support.  It's already used in the VS Code extension's webview, making the transition smoother.
- **Code Editor:** CodeMirror 6 - Selected for its customizability, performance, and support for various languages and extensions.  It offers a modern architecture and a rich API for building advanced editor features.
- **UI Toolkit:**  Consider using a lightweight UI toolkit like Material UI or Ant Design to accelerate UI development and ensure a consistent look and feel.

## Backend

- **Language:** TypeScript -  Provides type safety and improved code maintainability.  It's already used in the VS Code extension backend.
- **Tauri:**  Chosen for building the cross-platform desktop application.  It uses web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for the UI and Rust for the backend, offering a smaller bundle size and better performance compared to Electron.
- **LLM Integration:** Maintain existing support for multiple LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenRouter, etc.) using the existing abstraction layer.
- **File System:** Node.js `fs` module initially, potentially transitioning to a cross-platform library for better consistency across operating systems.
- **Terminal Emulator:** xterm.js - A well-maintained and feature-rich terminal emulator that can be easily embedded in web applications.
- **Linting/Compilation:**  Integrate language-specific linters and compilers directly.
- **Diffing Library:**  `diff` - A widely used library for comparing text and generating diffs.

## Build and Packaging

- **Tauri Build System:**  Leverage Tauri's build system for packaging the application for different platforms.

## Rationale

- **Focus on Web Technologies:**  Using web technologies for the UI allows for code reuse from the existing VS Code extension and simplifies development.
- **Performance and Bundle Size:** Tauri's use of Rust for the backend results in a smaller application bundle and improved performance compared to Electron.
- **CodeMirror's Flexibility:**  CodeMirror's extensive API and support for extensions allows for customization and implementation of advanced editor features.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**  Tauri enables building truly cross-platform applications with minimal platform-specific code.

# Cline Standalone App - Codebase Summary

## Key Components and Their Interactions

### Cline Core (`src/core/Cline.ts`)

- **Purpose:**  Manages the task lifecycle, including context loading, LLM interaction, tool execution, and user interaction.
- **Interactions:**
    - Communicates with LLM API providers via the `ApiHandler` interface.
    - Uses services like `TerminalManager`, `UrlContentFetcher`, and `languageParser` for tool execution and context loading.
    - Interacts with the UI via message passing to request user input and display results.

### API Handlers (`src/api`)

- **Purpose:**  Provides an abstraction layer for interacting with different LLM API providers.
- **Components:**  Each provider has a dedicated handler (e.g., `AnthropicHandler`, `OpenRouterHandler`).
- **Interactions:**  Implements the `ApiHandler` interface, which defines methods for creating messages and retrieving model information.

### Services (`src/services`)

- **Purpose:**  Provides core functionalities like file system access, web browsing, file searching, and source code parsing.
- **Components:**
    - `fs`:  Handles file system operations.
    - `UrlContentFetcher`: Fetches and processes web page content.
    - `ripgrep`:  Performs regex searches on files.
    - `tree-sitter`: Parses source code for definitions.
- **Interactions:**  Used by the `Cline` core for tool execution and context loading.

### Integrations (`src/integrations`)

- **Purpose:**  Handles interactions with the underlying operating system and UI elements.
- **Components:**
    - `editor`:  Handles editor integration (CodeMirror).
    - `terminal`:  Manages the embedded terminal.
    - `theme`:  Handles theme integration.
- **Interactions:**  Used by the `Cline` core to interact with the editor, terminal, and apply themes.

### Shared Components (`src/shared`)

- **Purpose:**  Contains shared TypeScript components used by both the backend and webview UI.
- **Components:**
    - `api`: API definitions and model information.
    - `ExtensionMessage`:  Defines the structure of messages passed between the extension and webview.
    - `HistoryItem`:  Represents a task history item.
- **Interactions:** Ensures consistency and reduces code duplication.

## Data Flow

1. **User Input:**  The user provides a task description and optional images via the webview UI.
2. **Message Passing:** The webview UI sends a message to the extension backend.
3. **Task Creation:** The extension backend creates a new `Cline` instance.
4. **Context Loading:**  `Cline` uses services to gather relevant context.
5. **LLM Interaction:**  `Cline` sends the task and context to the LLM API via the appropriate `ApiHandler`.
6. **Response Streaming:**  The LLM streams responses back to `Cline`.
7. **Content Block Processing:**  `Cline` processes each content block, displaying text and executing tools after user approval.
8. **Tool Execution:**  `Cline` uses services and integrations to execute tools.
9. **Result Display:**  Results are sent back to the webview UI for display.
10. **Task History:**  Completed tasks are saved to disk.
